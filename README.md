# Support-Vector-Machines-SVM-
Task 7: Support Vector Machines (SVM)
📋 Project Overview

This project is a complete implementation of Support Vector Machines (SVM) using Scikit-learn, focused on:

Binary classification using Breast Cancer dataset.

Training models with Linear and RBF kernels.

Visualizing decision boundaries (on 2D synthetic data).

Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.

Cross-validation and performance evaluation.


🛠️ Libraries Used

scikit-learn

matplotlib

seaborn

numpy

IPython.display (for clean Q&A rendering)

📈 Results

Achieved high accuracy on the Breast Cancer dataset.

Found optimal hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.

Demonstrated linear vs. RBF kernel differences visually.
